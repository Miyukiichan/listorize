# listorize

## Todo

- Export and maybe import to/from notion
- Text area or long string datatype
- Dynamic columns and values
  - Lookup editing
  - Show this on the note maybe?
- Think about what happens when a column type changes and there is existing data
  - Do we just do nothing and assume everything is a string?
  - Do we do some conversion?
  - Do we set the value to be blank?
- Show list structure in the sidebar
- Check for nested relationships before delete
  - Confirm if the user wants to delete all the nested data
  - Delete all the nested items, columns and notes
